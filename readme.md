There is a .toml file with dependencies, but some things should be installed from source:
- `cryojax` should be installed from source, [here](https://github.com/mjo22/cryojax))
- probably other things! 

You can try getting the other packages, and installing project, via:

```
git clone https://github.com/aevans1/ensemble_sim
cd ensemble_sim
python -m pip install .
```
